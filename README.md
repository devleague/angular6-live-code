# AngularDemo

## Installation
 - Start by installing angular-cli: `npm i -g angular-cli`
 - Generate a project using: `ng new angular-demo --style=scss`
 - Change into dir: `cd angular-demo`
 - Install project deps: `npm i`

## 1-housekeeping
 - Added box-sizing reset to `src/style.scss`
 - Delete contents of `src/app/app.component.html`

## 2-home-page
 - Create home component using `ng generate component home`
 - Go over all the files generated, and the changes to the `app.module.ts` file
 - Add home component to `app.component.html` using `app-home`
 - Create a `pages` dir under `app` and move the home component to `pages`
 - The page should be broken now (may need to restart `ng serve` to make this happen)

 - Add some data to the `home.component.ts` file and display that data in `home.component.html`
